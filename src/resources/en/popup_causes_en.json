    "close": "close",
	"reasons": "Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substances are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. Air pollution can have different causes. On one side there are natural causes like natural disasters. On the other side there are man-made causes of air pollution like traffic or industrial processes.",
	"consequences": "The consequences of air pollution are diverse. The environment is encumbered with consequences like climate change. Human beings are mainly encumbered with respiratory disease.",
    "consequencesOnHuman": "Fine dust of particle size PM10 can penetrate into deeper areas of the bronchi in humans through the nasal cavity. The smaller PM2.5 particles can penetrate into the bronchioles and alveoli and the ultrafine particles with a diameter of less than 0.1 Âµm even into the lung tissue and the bloodstream. The health effects of fine dust vary depending on the size and penetration depth of the particles. They range from irritation of the mucous membrane and local inflammation in the throat, trachea and bronchi or damage to the epithelium of the pulmonary alveoli to increased plaque formation in the blood vessels, an increased tendency to thrombosis or changes in the regulatory function of the autonomic nervous system (for example, with effects on heart rate variability).",
