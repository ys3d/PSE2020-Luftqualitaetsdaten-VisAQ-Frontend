    "intro": "You can normaly differenciate between two types of air pollution:",
    "descriptionNaturalReasons": "Natural sources: Natural sources include particles from upheavals or volcanic eruptions, but also so-called marine aerosols. These are liquid or solid salt crystals that are produced by emissions of plankton. Fine dust of natural origin also includes pollen, fungal spores and bacteria. Damage to health from geogenic or marine particles can be excluded. For allergy sufferers or people with hay fever, however, pollen, spores and bacteria can be harmful.",
    "descriptionHumanmadeReasons": "Anthropogenic sources: This type of particulate matter mainly comes from the exhaust of diesel engines, the chimneys of industrial plants and power plants, and the heating systems of households. In addition, particles are released from brake debris, car tires and the road surface. According to a study by the UBA, the total anthropogenic dust can be represented as follows:",
    "procentualIndustry": "• 45% comes from industrial processes",
    "procentualCars": "• 33% of total dust emissions come from traffic",
    "procentualRubble": "• 21% of emission is caused by rubble",
    "procentualOther": "• 1% comes from other sources",
    "nameOther": "other sources",
    "nameRubble": "rubble",
    "nameCars": "traffic",
    "nameIndustry": "industrial processes",
    "end": "These numbers represent the sources of total dust emissions. However, if the causes of the health-damaging fine dust are considered, the UBA names traffic as 50%. If the fine dust thrown up by traffic - abrasion from brakes, tires, road surface - is added, a further 25% is added.",
